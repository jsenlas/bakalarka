		abstract = {<p>The concept of using handwriting dynamics for electronic identification is discussed. A piezo-electric sensor pen for obtaining the pen point dynamics during writing is described. Design equations are derived and details of an operating device are presented. Typical output waveforms are shown to demonstrate the operation of the pen and to show the dissimilarities between dynamics of a genuine signature and an attempted forgery.</p>},
